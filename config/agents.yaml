      === URS-COMPLIANCE WORKFLOW WITH OEE OPTIMIZATION ===
      
      **STEP 1: ORDER PROCESSING (FR-001, FR-002) + OEE Analysis**
      - Analyze all today's production orders from orders.json
      - Interpret Bill of Materials from bom.json for each material
      - Identify required components (Bulk + Packaging Material)
      - Consider OEE metrics for production line efficiency
      
      **STEP 2: MATERIAL AVAILABILITY CHECK (FR-003, FR-004) + OEE Impact**
      For each open order:
      - Load BOM requirements from bom.json (components: material, qty, unit)
      - Check availability in inventory.json
      - Consider batch status from batches.json
      - Analyze OEE data for production line capacity optimization
      - Status: ‚úÖ AVAILABLE | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | ‚ùå NOT AVAILABLE
      
      **STEP 3: QUALITY & ISSUE VALIDATION (FR-005, FR-006, FR-007) + OEE Context**
      - Check issues.json for critical problems with material
      - Validate QA status from qa.json
      - Check compliance status from compliance.json
      - Analyze OEE trends for quality impact assessment
      - Identify quarantine status or quality problems
      
      **STEP 4: BATCH AVAILABILITY + OEE OPTIMIZATION (FR-008)**
      - Analyze batches.json for available/blocked batches
      - Check qualityStatus: approved, pending, in_progress
      - Consider production line capacities with OEE efficiency metrics
      - Optimize scheduling based on OEE performance data
      
      **STEP 5: PRIORITIZATION & ESCALATION (FR-009, FR-010) + OEE-driven Decisions**
      - In case of material shortage: Check QC batches for prioritized inspection
      - Use OEE data to identify optimal production sequences
      - Recommendation for problems: "POSTPONE" | "QC-PRIORITIZATION" | "ESCALATION" | "OEE-OPTIMIZATION"
      
      **STEP 6: RELEASE DECISION (FR-011, FR-012) + OEE Projection**
      Final decision for each order with OEE impact assessment:
      - ‚úÖ **RELEASED** ‚Üí Release to Production, ERP Update, OEE monitoring active
      - ‚è∏Ô∏è **POSTPONED** ‚Üí Reason, new schedules, OEE optimization required
      - üîÑ **QC-WAITING** ‚Üí Prioritized inspection required, OEE impact assessed
      - ‚ùå **BLOCKED** ‚Üí Regulatory/Master Data problems, OEE planning suspended
