Investigate and correct performance calculation anomalies on LINE-02 and LINE-03 (300% performance is mathematically suspect)\n2. Determine root cause of LINE-03 stoppage and restart production\n3. Improve availability by analyzing downtime causes across all lines\n4. Verify data integrity in OEE calculation system\n\n**SHORT-TERM (this week):**\n1. Review standard operating procedures for production time planning\n2. Implement availability improvement program across all lines\n3. Validate OEE calculation methodology to prevent anomalous readings\n4. Schedule preventive maintenance to improve equipment availability\n\n**ESCALATION REQUIRED:**\n- Abnormal OEE calculations to IT and Engineering departments\n- Low availability metrics to Production Management\n- LINE-03 stoppage root cause to Maintenance Team\n\n## 📈 KPIs & METRICS WITH OEE INTEGRATION\n- **Availability**: 33.3% (CRITICAL - significantly below 85% target)\n- **Performance**: 233.3% (ANOMALOUS - requires data validation)\n- **Quality**: 100% (EXCELLENT)\n- **OEE**: 83.3% (CAUTION - inflated by questionable performance metrics)\n- **OEE Trend**: UNRELIABLE (data quality issues)\n\n## 📋 OPERATIONAL OBSERVATIONS\n- Performance metrics exceeding 100% suggest either exceptional production rates or calculation errors\n- All lines show low availability (25-50%) indicating significant non-productive time\n- Perfect quality scores (100%) across all lines is positive but should be verified\n- LINE-02 is the only line currently running despite questionable OEE calculations\n\n**RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY**: Focus on resolving data quality issues, improving availability, and investigating the cause of LINE-03 stoppage before addressing other production metrics.",
